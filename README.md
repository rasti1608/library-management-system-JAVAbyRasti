# ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ Final Project

## Overview
This project is a **Spring Boot web application** that simulates how a real library operates.  
The idea is simple: one library, one copy per book, real users renting and returning in real time.  

Itâ€™s not just code â€” itâ€™s a complete system that shows how enterprise applications are structured, with **users, roles, books, rentals, and admin features** all tied together.

---

## What the System Does
- ðŸ‘¤ **User Accounts**
  - Anyone can register as a **User**
  - Default **Admin** is always present (canâ€™t be deleted or demoted)
  - Users log in with username & password  
  - Roles decide what you can do (User vs Admin)

- ðŸ“– **Books**
  - Each title exists as **one unique copy**  
  - Status is always clear: **AVAILABLE** or **RENTED**  
  - Users can browse, search, rent, and return  
  - Admins can add, edit, or delete books from the catalog  

- ðŸ”‘ **Roles**
  - **User** â†’ search, rent, return, edit own profile  
  - **Admin** â†’ everything Users can do + manage books, manage users, import/export data  

- ðŸ“‚ **Data Storage**
  - Everything is stored in **JSON files** (`users.json`, `books.json`, `rentals.json`)  
  - Simple, transparent, and easy to inspect  

- ðŸ“¤ **Import / Export**
  - Admins can export the entire catalog into a JSON file  
  - Admins can import more books (duplicates skipped)  

---

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Spring Boot  
- **Storage**: JSON files (no database)  
- **Authentication**: Custom login with roles  
- **Architecture**: Repository + Service + Controller layers  
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 & Mockito  

---

## Why This Project?
This system models a **specialized library** where each book is unique.  
It keeps the focus on **clear business rules** and **clean Spring concepts** instead of inventory complexity.  

The project proves:  
- You can build a professional-grade application in a short timeframe.  
- Java & Spring skills are applied in a real-world scenario.  
- Everything is backed by unit tests, documentation, and proper structure.  

---

## Roadmap
1. **Core Structure** â€“ Entities, repositories, services  
2. **Authentication** â€“ Registration, login, role checks  
3. **Book Management** â€“ CRUD, search, rent/return  
4. **Admin Tools** â€“ Manage users, import/export books  
5. **Testing & Docs** â€“ Unit tests, integration tests, user guide

## Status
ðŸš€ Work in progress â€” but the foundation is here.  
This isnâ€™t just an idea. Itâ€™s being built, line by line, commit by commit.  

Stay tuned.
